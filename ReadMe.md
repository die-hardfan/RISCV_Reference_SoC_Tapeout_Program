# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program

## About the Program
The **20-week program** aims to provide practical experience and knowledge of **ASIC design flow** to engineering students interested in the field. The goal is to **design, verify, package, solder, and power-on** a RISC-V SoC board.

- The **first 10 weeks** involve rigorous training in theory and hands-on basics required to produce a **GDSII file** using open-source tools.  
- The **top 50 students** will then train with **industry-standard tools** over the next 6 weeks.  
- Finally, the **top 20 students** will be selected for the **tapeout** of their designs during the last 4 weeks.

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as an introduction to the **first 10 weeks** of the program and as a **collection of links** to all remaining week-wise repositories.  
It contains:

- Information on **basic VLSI SoC design and planning**
- Commands to **install necessary tools** on your system
